# VIPER algorithm applied to splicing cancer-driver program

## Overview
1. [ ] Inference and validation of splicing factor activities
    - [ ] download GO splicing factors
    - [ ] download CCLE splicing factor omics
    - [ ] download SpliceAid RBP exon interactions
    - [ ] download CLIP seq from ENCODE
    - [ ] validate concordance CLIP seq vs RBP vs SpliceAid interactions
    - [ ] inference with correlations
    - [ ] inference with WGCNA
    - [ ] inference with ARACNE
    - [ ] inference with robustica
    - [ ] inference with multiomic signatures
2. [ ] Chart and validate splicing factor activities in cancer
3. [ ] tissue specific vs pan-cancer regulatory networks

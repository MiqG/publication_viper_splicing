# VIPER algorithm applied to splicing cancer-driver program

## Overview
1. [ ] Inference and validation of splicing factor activities
    - [X] download GO splicing factors (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/geneset_page.jsp?geneSetName=GOBP_RNA_SPLICING)
    - [X] download GO RNA binding (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/human/geneset/GOMF_RNA_BINDING.html)
    - [X] download CCLE splicing factor omics
    - [X] download SpliceAid RBP exon interactions (http://srv00.recas.ba.infn.it/SpliceAidF/)
    - [X] download eCLIP seq from ENCODE
    - [X] validate concordance CLIP seq vs RBP vs SpliceAid interactions
        - eCLIP vs RBP KD --> strong changes in splicing do not occur where RBP binds
    - [ ] network inference: save raw outputs and process them to make inference of regulation sign and magnitude
        - [ ] with correlations: mRNA levels SF vs exon inclusion
        - [ ] with WGCNA
        - [ ] with ARACNE
        - [ ] with robustica
        - [ ] with multiomic signatures
    - [ ] network evaluation:
        - we want to find those exons sensitive to changes in splicing factor activity
        - "correlation" between association scores and observed inclusion changes upon KD of that splicing factor
        - or precision and recall generating different sets of exons
            - from RBP KDs, consider different delta PSI thresholds (consider also possible % change thresholds) to define targets and non-targets
            - from eCLIP, we can only have true positives
            - from SpliceAid, we can only have true positives
        - evaluate considering or not the directionality of the SF-exon interactions
2. [ ] Chart and validate splicing factor activities in cancer
3. [ ] tissue specific vs pan-cancer regulatory networks
